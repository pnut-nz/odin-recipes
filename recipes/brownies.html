        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch.<br>
             These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen. </p>
