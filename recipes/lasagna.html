        <li>12 lasagna noodles  </li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese  </li>

        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.<br>
             Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.<br>
              Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
              <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
             Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.<br>
              In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
              <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>
             Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. <br>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
